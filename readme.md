# Automating Excel Tasks using Python

## Abstract 
This project involves automating all common Excel tasks as well as rare more complex tasks using Python modules. We start off with basic tasks such as performing column and row operations, applying commonly used formulas such as SUMIF, SUMPROFUCT, COUNTIF and VLOOKUP. We then move on to automate more complex tasks such as summary tables, pivot tables, styling and formating.
